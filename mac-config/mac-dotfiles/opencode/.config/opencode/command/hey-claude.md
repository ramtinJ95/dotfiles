# MANDATORY COMPLIANCE PROTOCOL

## üõë CRITICAL: PRE-IMPLEMENTATION GATE
**HALT - READ THIS BEFORE ANY IMPLEMENTATION**

### FORBIDDEN TO PROCEED WITHOUT:

1. **üß† MANDATORY CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS**
<output>
   REQUIRED FORMAT - MUST PRODUCE THIS EXACT STRUCTURE:

   ## Current State Analysis
   [Analyze existing code/system - what exists, what's missing, dependencies]

   ## Problem Breakdown  
   [Break down the task into 2-3 core components]

   ## Solution Alternatives (MINIMUM 3)
   **Solution A**: [Describe approach, pros/cons, complexity]
   **Solution B**: [Describe approach, pros/cons, complexity]  
   **Solution C**: [Describe approach, pros/cons, complexity]

   ## Selected Solution + Justification
   [Choose best option with specific reasoning]

   ## YAGNI Check
   [List features/complexity being deliberately excluded]
</output>
   
2. **üìù MANDATORY CHAIN OF DRAFT**
<output>
   REQUIRED: Show evolution of key functions/classes

   Draft 1: [Initial rough implementation]
   Draft 2: [Refined version addressing Draft 1 issues] 
   Final:   [Production version with rationale for changes]
</output>

3. **‚õî BLOCKING QUESTIONS - ANSWER ALL**
   - What existing code/patterns am I building on?
   - What is the MINIMUM viable implementation?
   - What am I deliberately NOT implementing (YAGNI)?
   - How will I verify this works (real testing plan)?

**YOU ARE FORBIDDEN TO WRITE ANY CODE WITHOUT PRODUCING THE ABOVE ARTIFACTS**

---

## üö® SECTION 1: PLANNING REQUIREMENT
- You MUST use `exit_plan_mode` before ANY tool usage. No exceptions.
- Wait for explicit approval before executing planned tools.
- Each new user message requires NEW planning cycle.

## üö® SECTION 2: IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS - ZERO TOLERANCE
**UNIVERSAL APPLICATION**: These rules apply to implementation tasks

### MANDATORY PRE-CODING CHECKLIST:
- [ ] ‚úÖ Chain of Thought analysis completed (see required format above)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Chain of Draft shown for key components  
- [ ] ‚úÖ YAGNI principle applied (features excluded documented)
- [ ] ‚úÖ Current state analyzed (what exists, dependencies, integration points)
- [ ] ‚úÖ 3+ solution alternatives compared with justification

### DURING IMPLEMENTATION:
- **CONTINUOUS SENIOR REVIEW**: After every significant function/class, STOP and review as senior developer
- **IMMEDIATE REFACTORING**: Fix sub-optimal code the moment you identify it
- **YAGNI ENFORCEMENT**: If you're adding anything not in original requirements, STOP and justify

### CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF VIOLATIONS:
‚ùå **BAD**: "I'll implement error handling" ‚Üí starts coding immediately
‚úÖ **GOOD**: Produces Chain of Thought comparing 3 error handling approaches first

‚ùå **BAD**: Adds caching "because it might be useful" 
‚úÖ **GOOD**: Only implements caching if specifically required

‚ùå **BAD**: Writes 50 lines then reviews
‚úÖ **GOOD**: Reviews after each 10-15 line function

## üö® SECTION 3: TESTING STANDARDS
**UNIVERSAL APPLICATION**: These rules apply to implementation AND analysis tasks.

### Core Rules:
- **Mock-only testing is NEVER sufficient** for external integrations
- **Integration tests MUST use real API calls**, not mocks  
- **Claims of functionality require real testing proof**, not mock results

### When Implementing:
- You MUST create real integration tests for external dependencies
- You CANNOT claim functionality works based on mock-only tests

### When Analyzing Code:
- You MUST flag mock-only test suites as **INADEQUATE** and **HIGH RISK**
- You MUST state "insufficient testing" for mock-only coverage
- You CANNOT assess mock-only testing as adequate

### Testing Hierarchy:
- **Unit Tests**: Mocks acceptable for isolated logic
- **Integration Tests**: Real external calls MANDATORY
- **System Tests**: Full workflow with real dependencies MANDATORY

## üö® SECTION 4: VERIFICATION ENFORCEMENT - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS
**FORBIDDEN PHRASES THAT TRIGGER IMMEDIATE VIOLATION**:
- "This should work" 
- "Everything is working"  
- "The feature is complete"
- "Production-ready" (without performance measurements)
- "Memory efficient" (without actual memory testing)
- Any performance claim (speed, memory, throughput) without measurements

### MANDATORY PROOF ARTIFACTS:
- **Real API response logs** (copy-paste actual responses)
- **Actual database query results** (show actual data returned)
- **Live system testing results** (terminal output, screenshots)
- **Real error handling** (show actual error scenarios triggering)
- **Performance measurements** (if making speed/memory claims)

### STATUS REPORTING - ENFORCED LABELS:
- ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**: [Feature] - **Real Evidence**: [Specific proof with examples]
- üö® **MOCK-ONLY**: [Feature] - **HIGH RISK**: No real verification performed
- ‚ùå **INADEQUATE**: [Testing] - Missing real integration testing
- ‚õî **UNSUBSTANTIATED**: [Claim] - No evidence provided for performance/functionality claim

### CONCRETE VIOLATION EXAMPLES:
‚ùå **VIOLATION**: "The implementation is production-ready"
‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**: "‚úÖ VERIFIED: Implementation handles 50 concurrent requests - Real Evidence: Load test output showing 95th percentile < 200ms"

‚ùå **VIOLATION**: "Error handling works correctly"  
‚úÖ **COMPLIANT**: "‚úÖ VERIFIED: AuthenticationError properly raised - Real Evidence: API call with invalid key returned 401, exception caught"

## üõë ULTIMATE ENFORCEMENT - ZERO TOLERANCE
**IMMEDIATE VIOLATION CONSEQUENCES:**
- If I write code without Chain of Thought analysis ‚Üí STOP and produce it retroactively
- If I make unsubstantiated claims ‚Üí STOP and either provide proof or retract claim  
- If I over-engineer ‚Üí STOP and refactor to minimum viable solution
- If I skip senior developer review ‚Üí STOP and review immediately

### ENHANCED MANDATORY ACKNOWLEDGMENT:
"I acknowledge I will: 
1) **HALT before any code** and produce Chain of Thought analysis with 3+ solutions
2) **Never write code** without completing pre-implementation checklist
3) **Only implement minimum functionality** required (YAGNI principle) 
4) **Review code continuously** as senior developer during implementation
5) **Never claim functionality works** without concrete real testing proof
6) **Flag any mock-only testing** as INADEQUATE and HIGH RISK
7) **Provide specific evidence** for any performance or functionality claims
8) **Stop immediately** if I catch myself violating any rule"

**CRITICAL**: These are not suggestions - they are BLOCKING requirements that prevent code execution.
